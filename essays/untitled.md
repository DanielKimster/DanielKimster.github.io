<p>
I recently had the chance to work with Semantic UI in designing websites. They advertise that it's designed to allow more straightforward approaches to building webpages, but my experience has been a little more daunting than that. From having to struggle with the API to line up an element correctly, to having to wrestle with the framework just to center something, the framework ended up being a lot less straightforward than I thought it would be.
I can see see the reasoning behind using a framework, but sometimes it might not be worth the hassle.

<p> The first project that I tackled using Semantic UI was to make a mock-up of the Island Snow website. Doing this website mock-up with Semantic overall probably took a little less time than trying design it on my own (particularly the top bar menu and dropdown selections), I feel like the sacrifice was a lot of control and customizability. I am by no means an expert at html or css, but it became frustrating when the framework didn't behave the way it said it would, or the API didn't quite have the instructions to make certain elements behave a certain way. One particular instance is when I wanted to remove the white space between two sections and ended up having to remove the semantic tags because it would only remove the whitespace under certain window conditions. Trying to use the fitted tag to remove the space ended up with the element attaching itself to the left side of the page instead of centering. Another instance was when I tried to use the fluid class to have a picture expand into one div, but it would instead expand into the grandparent div.
