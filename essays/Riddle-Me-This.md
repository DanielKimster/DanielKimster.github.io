<p>Whenever the Riddler had a puzzle for the Batman to solve, he would often use the catchphrase "Riddle me this". In the same sense, many aspiring software developers use the platform Stack Overflow to get their own problems solved, but many times these questions pale in comparison to what the Batman had to solve for The Riddler. This reminds me of the idiom "ask a stupid question, get a stupid answer. There are right ways to ask a question and there are wrong ways, and for various reasons, people don't often put the thought behind their questions before they ask them. This can lead to "stupid questions" being asked, wasting time for both the asker and the askee. It is important for Software Engineers to ask "smart questions" to both further their learning and to show that they are actually trying to solve the problem instead of passing off the burden to the people they are asking, because solving problems are the keystone of what makes someone a software engineer.</p>
