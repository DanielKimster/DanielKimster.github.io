Keri Smith, author of Wreck This Journal, said that to create is to destroy. This is the nature of manufacturing: we break down raw materials to reform them into something new. Compilers and assemblers do this when they process code to create our programs too. We do this even when we write the code: taking bits and pieces of our ideas and breaking them down into concrete steps for a computer to take in order to mesh together a program that does something functional. Being able to breakdown and analyze libraries and creating ways of solving some problem is my favorite part of Software Engineering. 

## In the Beginning...
Ever since I was little, I had a habit of breaking things apart to figure out how they work. I believe all tinkerers start out that way. By piecing together the little bits of machine or electronics to determine what moves what, one can learn the basic physical or electromechanical principles that drive things to move the way that they do. I feel like this was the beginning of my journey into Software Engineering. I felt the same sense of novelty and discovery for when I started learning how to program in C++ in high school. I love learning how things work and how to take the pieces of something and create something new. This is why I look forward to diving deeper into Software Engineering.

## Hopes and Dreams
Around the time I first started learning about C++, I was also introduced to video games on the computer and it had since become my dream to work for Blizzard or Microsoft as a software engineer, but I never knew where to begin. Hopefully through my future experiences in my Software Engineering course, I will get a better grasp on where I need to research or explore in order to take my first steps into the corporate world of software and game design.
