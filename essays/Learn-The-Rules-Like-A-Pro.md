<p> Pablo Picasso once said "Learn the rules like a pro, so you can break them like an artist," which to me brings about images of escape artists breaking free of their shackles or con-artists worming their way out of getting caught by the law. Much like these artists, software engineers have to learn to work with the rules that they are given to produce the type of art that they can call their own code. Too much freedom leads to bad design, spaghetti code, and convolution. On the other hand, restrictions can lead to greater creativity and even be inspiration to produce better code. Working with ESLint has given me greater insights into how to write more precise and concise code by doing away with some fluff while making the code easier to read </p>
