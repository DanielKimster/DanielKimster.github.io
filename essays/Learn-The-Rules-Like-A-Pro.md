<p> Pablo Picasso once said "Learn the rules like a pro, so you can break them like an artist," which to me brings about images of escape artists breaking free of their shackles or con-artists worming their way out of getting caught by the law. Much like these artists, software engineers have to learn to work with the rules that they are given to produce the type of art that they can call their own code. Too much freedom leads to bad design, spaghetti code, and convolution. On the other hand, restrictions can lead to greater creativity and even be inspiration to produce even better code. One such restriction is a coding standard like using ESLint in IntelliJ.</p> <p> Working with ESLint has given me greater insights into how to write more precise and concise code by doing away with some fluff while making the code easier to read. ESLint can also be a useful aid in teaching someone about the ECMAScript coding standard to ensure their code will work properly across various platforms. The tool helps one catch not only syntax errors, but even some logical errors that one might have missed in their code. It helps to catch those pesky missing closing brackets and parentheses that we often miss when blazing forward with our logic. It helps drastically in letting one be creative with their work as opposed to worrying about the syntax. After you're done getting your ideas onto the </p>
