Keri Smith, author of Wreck This Journal, said that to create is to destroy. This is the nature of manufacturing: we break down raw materials to reform them into something new. Compilers and assemblers do this when they process code to create our programs too. We do this even when we write the code: taking bits and pieces of our ideas and breaking them down into concrete steps for a computer to take in order to mesh together a program that does something functional. Being able to breakdown and analyze libraries and creating ways of solving some problem is my favorite part of Software Engineering. 
Ever since I was little, I had a habit of breaking things apart to figure out how they work. I believe all tinkerers start out that way. By piecing together the little bits of machine or electronics to determine what moves what, one can learn the basic physical or electromechanical principles that drive things to move the way that they do.
