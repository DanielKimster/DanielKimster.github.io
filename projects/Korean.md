안녕하세요? Or in English that is "Hello". A language can be so much more than just a tool to communicate. It can also be a source of entertainment and culture. This is something I experienced first-hand through my experiences in learning Korean. When I was awarded the Critical Language Scholarship (CLS) in 2011, it gave me a chance to jump-start my learning in Korean. I had originally taken a language test when applying for Manoa to see if I could skip some classes for my language requirement for my degree. It ended up becoming my second major as the test administrator encouraged me to take advanced courses in Korea, eventually leading me to go on a year-long exchange to South Korea and even landing me an internship at a Korean Mobile App company. Living in Korea while interacting with co-workers and fellow students gave me a deeper appreciation for not only the language but also the culture and history behind it. From learning puns in Korean to learning about the heritage and how the written language was created in the 15th century, it has been a wild journey full of memories that I will cherish forever.
