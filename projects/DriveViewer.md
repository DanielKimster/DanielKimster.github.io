I was given the opportunity to intern with a mobile app developer and as my project during my time their, they had me create and manage my own app project. Being that I hadn't had any Android app experience at the time, they had me design an application that could open up and view files in one's own Google Drive. Working two days a week while also attending classes, I was able to get some basic functionality with the Google API for Android.<br>

This was a unique experience as I didn't have any one holding my hand and I had to schedule and manage my own time while also learning how to read the API and also test for bugs. The only real guidance that I recieved from the company that I was interning for was learning how to implement the Agile development mindset and to estimate my own coding abilities to plan a schedule for when I would meet certain milestones in the project. I loved working with this company as well as getting to experience working and managing on my own application project. This experience gave me key insights into the software development world.
